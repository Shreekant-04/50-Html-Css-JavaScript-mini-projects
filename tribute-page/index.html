            <b> Early Life and Education </b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, Steve
                Paul Jobs was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. From a young age,
                Jobs displayed a keen interest in electronics and technology. He
                attended Reed College in Oregon but dropped out after six
                months, opting instead to audit creative courses that intrigued
                him, such as calligraphy. This seemingly whimsical decision
                would later influence the aesthetic design of Apple products.

            <b> The Birth of Apple </b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In 1976, Jobs co-founded Apple Computer, Inc. with his friend
                Steve Wozniak in the Jobs family garage. Their mission was to
                make personal computing accessible to everyone. The Apple I and
                Apple II computers were among the first to offer a user-friendly
                interface, setting the stage for the personal computer
                revolution.

            <b> Transforming Technology </b>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Jobs' innovative spirit truly shone with the introduction of the
                Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-market personal computer
                featuring a graphical user interface. His commitment to elegant
                design and user experience became hallmarks of Apple's
                philosophy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Despite his success, Jobs faced setbacks. In 1985, he was ousted
                from Apple following a power struggle within the company.
                Undeterred, he founded NeXT, a computer platform development
                company, and acquired the computer graphics division of
                Lucasfilm, which became Pixar Animation Studios. Pixar's success
                with films like "Toy Story" marked another milestone in Jobs'
                illustrious career.

            <b> Return to Apple and the Golden Era </b>
            <p>
              In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back to the company he
              co-founded. His return marked the beginning of Apple's golden era.
              Under his leadership, Apple launched a series of groundbreaking
              products that redefined industries:

              <li>
                Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, but his legacy lives
                on. His approach to technology and design has inspired countless
                innovators and entrepreneurs. Jobs' philosophy of integrating
                technology with the humanities, creating products that delight
                and empower users, continues to drive Apple's mission.
              </li>
              <li>
                Jobs once said, "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a
                follower." His life and work exemplify this belief, showing us
                that the pursuit of excellence and the courage to think
                differently can indeed change the world.
